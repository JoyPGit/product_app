Soap vs rest
Spring data spa

Jdbc -> language agnostic any db, jpa


/////////// project overview

1 shirts, pants, caps
2 entity
schema, interface (joins and other stuff)
3 repository
4 db
4 service

class category{
    id, category_name
}

class product{
    id, name, fk category_id
}

what does JPA do?

body to entity mapping like shirt then what about default or other values
primary key, foreign key
save -> how to map for shirt only

entity contains ony getters and setters so as to play with data once fetched from db

hibernate db bakchodi, tables and mapping from entity
hikari maintains thread pool for db connectivity and helps efficiency
